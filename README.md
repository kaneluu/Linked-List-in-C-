# Linked-List-in-C++
How to create a linked list in C++
using three files: a header file, a implementation file, and a main file

First we need to understand the concept of Linked List. A linked list contains of several nodes that have the same structure.
The structure of a node include an integer variable (it can be different type of variable), and a node type pointer.

NODE
==========
| int    |
| pointer|---->
==========

As we can see, the int variable is the node's data and the pointer always points to another node.
